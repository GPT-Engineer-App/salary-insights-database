# salary-insights-database

I want a searchable salary database (make it look like glassdoor). Users should be able to: 
- Create a salary data point (ask for salary, role, years of experience and education)
- Users should be able to search for a role r copany and get aggregated insights based 
- Example insights/stats: 
--list of roles and average salary
-- insights on whether you are overpaid or underpaid

Mock any backend fucntionality, we want to test e2e
